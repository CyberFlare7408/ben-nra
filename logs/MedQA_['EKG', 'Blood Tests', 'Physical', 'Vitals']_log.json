The key features supporting this are: - **Fluctuating muscle weakness** that worsens with activity and improves with rest. - **Ocular involvement**: double vision (diplopia) and ptosis, both worsening later in the day. - **Bulbar symptoms**: intermittent dysarthria and dysphagia, especially with fatigue. - **No sensory symptoms**: no numbness, tingling, or pain. - **No muscle wasting, fasciculations, or autonomic involvement**. - **No recent infection or systemic symptoms**. The absence of respiratory involvement is reassuring at this stage, but the bulbar symptoms are concerning for possible progression. **Differential diagnoses** I am considering include: - **Myasthenia gravis** (most likely) - **Lambert-E"

Would you recommend starting treatment as for generalized MG at this stage, or would you prefer to wait for confirmatory testing? 2. **Risk of Myasthenic Crisis**: The patient currently denies respiratory symptoms, but given the bulbar involvement, would you recommend any specific monitoring or precautions to reduce the risk of impending myasthenic crisis while awaiting test results? 3. **Antibody Testing**: If acetylcholine receptor antibodies are negative"

I agree that the constellation of symptoms\u2014ocular and bulbar involvement with fatigable weakness and no sensory or autonomic findings\u2014strongly supports early generalized myasthenia gravis. A few follow-up points for your input: 1. **Initiation of Therapy**: Would you recommend starting with pyridostigmine alone initially, or would you advocate for early introduction of immunosuppressive therapy (such as corticosteroids), given the presence of bulbar symptoms? If so, do you have a preferred steroid regimen or adjunctive immunosuppressant at this stage? 2. **Monitoring and Admission Criteria**: Given the current absence of respiratory symptoms but the presence of bulbar involvement, would you recommend baseline pulmonary function testing (FVC, NIF) in the outpatient setting, or should we consider admission for close monitoring while starting therapy? Are there specific thresholds (e.g., FVC <20 mL/kg) you use to guide"

Baseline FVC and NIF should be obtained; admit for close monitoring if FVC <20 mL/kg, NIF <\u201330 cm H2O, or if there is worsening bulbar or respiratory function\u2014otherwise, outpatient management with strict return precautions may be reasonable if stable.

Outpatient follow-up can be scheduled within 48\u201372 hours, and the patient has reliable transportation and support at home. I will ensure the patient is educated on red flag symptoms (increasing difficulty swallowing, speaking, or breathing) and provided with clear instructions for urgent return if these develop. 2. **Initiation of Immunosuppression:** I agree with your recommendation to start both pyridostigmine and a moderate dose of prednisone, given the bulbar symptoms. I will monitor closely for steroid-induced worsening of weakness, especially in the first 1\u20132 weeks.

Azathioprine is my preferred first-line steroid-sparing agent, typically started if steroid taper is anticipated or if steroid side effects emerge; mycophenolate is an alternative if azathioprine is contraindicated or not tolerated. 3. Early monitoring should focus on steroid-induced myopathy, hyperglycemia, infection risk, GI symptoms, and azathioprine-related cytopenias or hepatotoxicity (with regular CBC and LFTs).
