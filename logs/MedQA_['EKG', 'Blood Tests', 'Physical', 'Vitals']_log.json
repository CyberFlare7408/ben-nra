Do you have a preferred initial immunosuppressive agent in this scenario? 3. **Monitoring for Myasthenic Crisis:** Given the patient\u2019s intermittent bulbar symptoms, would you recommend inpatient observation during the initiation of therapy, or is outpatient management reasonable if baseline respiratory function and swallowing assessment are reassuring? 4. **Thymectomy Considerations:**"

If significant bulbar symptoms persist despite pyridostigmine, I initiate corticosteroids (prednisone) early, with azathioprine as my preferred steroid-sparing agent if long-term immunosuppression is needed. 3. Outpatient management is reasonable if baseline FVC/NIF and swallowing are reassuring, but admit for observation if there is any concern for rapid progression or aspiration risk. 4.

There is no obvious hepatomegaly, and no discrete abdominal masses are appreciated beyond the splenic enlargement. The cervical lymphadenopathy is bilateral, non-tender, and mobile, with no overlying skin changes. No axillary or inguinal lymphadenopathy is detected on exam. There are no signs of acute infection, and the absence of pruritus, bruising, or bleeding makes acute leukemia or other marrow-infiltrative processes less likely, though not excluded. **Questions for you:** 1.

If so, should we delay the bone marrow biopsy until after PET-CT, or proceed concurrently? 2. **CNS Prophylaxis Consideration:** Given the presence of B symptoms and splenic involvement, do you see any features here that would prompt consideration of CNS prophylaxis at this stage, or would you reserve that decision until after histopathology and full staging? 3. **Supportive Care:** While awaiting tissue diagnosis, would you recommend empiric corticosteroids if the patient\u2019s symptoms worsen, or should we avoid steroids to preserve diagnostic yield? 4"

Although the breast ultrasound shows normal readings, the clinical presentation raises concern for a possible malignancy, as breast cancer can sometimes present with a palpable mass even if initial imaging is inconclusive. An oncologist specializes in the diagnosis and management of cancers, including breast cancer, and is best equipped to guide further evaluation (such as biopsy) and treatment if necessary."

A few points and questions to further refine our assessment and management: 1. **Urinary Frequency:** While increased urinary frequency could be secondary to endometritis (due to local irritation), I agree that a concurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) should be ruled out, especially since postpartum women are at increased risk. I will order a urinalysis and urine culture. Would you recommend empiric coverage for UTI at this stage, or wait for results unless symptoms develop? 2. **Shortness of Breath:** The patient reports mild, intermittent shortness of breath without chest pain, palpitations, or DVT signs. While this could be related to postpartum physiological changes, I am mindful of the risk of"
