Would you consider this subacute progression typical for MG, or does it raise any concern for alternative or coexisting diagnoses? 2. **Bulbar Involvement:** Given the presence of dysarthria and dysphagia, albeit intermittent and fatigue-related, would you recommend any immediate precautions regarding swallowing assessment or respiratory monitoring, even in the absence of current breathing difficulties? 3. **Differential Diagnosis:** - **Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS):** The absence of autonomic symptoms and the presence of ocular/bulbar involvement make LEMS less likely, but would you recommend any specific screening for"

For LEMS, consider voltage-gated calcium channel antibody testing and a search for underlying malignancy if clinical suspicion arises, but the current presentation is more consistent with MG."

I agree that the clinical features and subacute progression are most consistent with myasthenia gravis, and I will proceed with the recommended investigations and monitoring. A few additional points for discussion: 1. **Antibody Testing:** In your experience, how often do you encounter seronegative MG (negative for both AChR and MuSK antibodies), and would you recommend proceeding to single-fiber EMG in all such cases if clinical suspicion remains high? 2. **Thymic Imaging:** Given the patient\u2019s age and lack of known thymic disease, would you recommend a CT or MRI of the chest as the initial imaging modality to assess for thymoma, or is one preferred over the other in your practice? 3. **Early Treatment:** Pending confirmatory testing, would you consider initiating symptomatic therapy (e.g., pyridostigmine) at this stage, or do you prefer to wait for antibody results?

Do you have a preferred initial immunosuppressive agent in this scenario? 3. **Monitoring for Myasthenic Crisis:** Given the patient\u2019s intermittent bulbar symptoms, would you recommend inpatient observation during the initiation of therapy, or is outpatient management reasonable if baseline respiratory function and swallowing assessment are reassuring? 4. **Thymectomy Considerations:**"

For single-fiber EMG in cases with prominent ocular/bulbar symptoms, I prioritize facial muscles (e.g., orbicularis oculi, frontalis) as they are more sensitive in these presentations; limb muscles are less sensitive in purely ocular/bulbar MG. 2. If significant bulbar symptoms persist despite pyridostigmine, I initiate corticosteroids (prednisone) early, with azathioprine as my preferred steroid-sparing agent if long-term immunosuppression is needed. 3. Outpatient management is reasonable if baseline FVC/NIF and swallowing are reassuring, but admit for observation if there is any concern for rapid progression or aspiration risk. 4. Please clarify the patient\u2019s age and antibody status to guide thymectomy recommendations, as this is generally considered in younger, AChR-positive patients or if thymoma is present."
