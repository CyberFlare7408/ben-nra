If antibody testing is negative or equivocal, I prioritize SFEMG for its higher sensitivity, especially in ocular muscles (orbicularis oculi) or facial muscles if bulbar symptoms predominate. 3. For imaging, a chest CT (preferred over X-ray) should be performed to evaluate for thymoma in all new MG diagnoses."

In your experience, does the presence of bulbar symptoms at onset increase the likelihood of MuSK antibody positivity, or does it still favor AChR? 2. **Seronegative MG:** For patients who are seronegative for both AChR and MuSK antibodies but have classic clinical and electrophysiological features, do you routinely pursue LRP4 antibody testing, or is this reserved for atypical or refractory cases? 3. **Thymoma Workup:** If chest CT reveals a thymic mass, do you recommend early surgical referral regardless of antibody status, or are there specific features that would prompt"

For respiratory monitoring, regularly assess single breath count (<20), forced vital capacity (<15\u201320 mL/kg), and negative inspiratory force (<-20 cm H2O); inpatient monitoring is warranted if these thresholds are approached or if there is any evidence of rapid progression or aspiration risk. 3.

I agree that a perinephric or renal abscess is high on the differential, especially given the subacute course, persistent fever, and localized deep flank pain in the absence of urinary symptoms. The recent antibiotic exposure could have partially treated a urinary or systemic infection, potentially masking classic urinary findings. A few points and questions to further refine our differential and management: 1. **Absence of Urinary Symptoms:** - While the lack of dysuria, frequency, or hematuria makes classic pyelonephritis less likely, I agree that a deep-seated infection (abscess) could present this way, especially if antibiotics have blunted the typical presentation. - Would you consider atypical organisms or resistant pathogens more likely in this context, given recent antibiotic exposure? 2. **Other Infectious Considerations:** - Do you think we should also consider other deep-seated infections (e.g., psoas abscess, vertebral"

This could support the diagnosis. 2. **Other TORCH Infections:** While rubella fits best, should we also consider CMV (which can cause hearing loss and petechiae), or toxoplasmosis (which can cause ocular findings), even though the cardiac findings are less typical?

A few points for further discussion and clarification: 1. **Urinary Symptoms:** The patient reports increased urinary frequency but no dysuria, hematuria, or difficulty voiding. While this could be due to local irritation from endometritis, I want to ensure we are not missing a concurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) or pyelonephritis, especially given the mild bibasilar crackles on lung exam (which could also be postpartum atelectasis). Once the urinalysis returns, would you recommend adding coverage for a possible UTI if there is evidence of infection, or would you continue with the current regimen? 2. **Bibasilar Crackles:**"

The bibasilar crackles are likely benign (atelectasis), but monitor for respiratory symptoms or hypoxia; if new/worsening, consider chest imaging to rule out pneumonia or fluid overload.

Would you base this on clinical improvement (e.g., afebrile for 24\u201348 hours, resolution of uterine tenderness), or do you have a preferred minimum duration? 3. **Consideration of atypical pathogens:** In the absence of classic risk factors (e.g., prolonged rupture of membranes, chorioamn"
