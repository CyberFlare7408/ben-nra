Consider EMG with repetitive nerve stimulation if diagnosis remains unclear."

I agree that the clinical picture is highly suggestive of myasthenia gravis, particularly given the classic pattern of fatigable weakness, ocular and bulbar involvement, and absence of sensory or autonomic symptoms. A few points to clarify and discuss further: 1. **Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS):** While less likely, would you agree that LEMS is lower on the differential given the absence of autonomic symptoms, lack of significant lower limb predominance, and the fact that weakness improves with rest rather than activity? Also, there is no mention of underlying malignancy or risk factors. 2. **Other Differentials:** - **Botulism** seems unlikely given the subacute progression, lack of autonomic features, and absence of gastrointestinal prodrome. - **Mitochondrial myopathies** or other congenital myasthenic syndromes are less likely given the adult onset and lack"

A few additional points and questions for your consideration: 1. **Antibody Testing:** - Would you recommend testing for both acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and MuSK antibodies initially, or do you typically reserve MuSK testing for AChR-negative cases? - In your experience, how often do you encounter seronegative MG, and are there any clinical features that would prompt you to suspect this variant early? 2. **Electrodiagnostic Studies:** - If antibody testing is equivocal or negative, would you prioritize repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) or single-fiber EMG (SFEMG) for further evaluation? - Are there particular muscle groups you prefer to test in cases with prominent ocular and bulbar symptoms? 3. **Imaging:** -"

I typically start with AChR antibody testing and add MuSK if AChR is negative or if there are prominent bulbar symptoms; seronegative MG occurs in about 10\u201315% of cases, often with isolated ocular or MuSK-like features. 2. If antibody testing is negative or equivocal, I prioritize SFEMG for its higher sensitivity, especially in ocular muscles (orbicularis oculi) or facial muscles if bulbar symptoms predominate. 3. For imaging, a chest CT (preferred over X-ray) should be performed to evaluate for thymoma in all new MG diagnoses."

I have a few follow-up questions and points for clarification as we proceed with the workup: 1. **Ocular vs. Generalized MG:** Given that this patient has both ocular (ptosis, diplopia) and mild bulbar/proximal limb involvement, would you consider this an early generalized MG rather than purely ocular? In your experience, does the presence of bulbar symptoms at onset increase the likelihood of MuSK antibody positivity, or does it still favor AChR? 2. **Seronegative MG:** For patients who are seronegative for both AChR and MuSK antibodies but have classic clinical and electrophysiological features, do you routinely pursue LRP4 antibody testing, or is this reserved for atypical or refractory cases? 3. **Thymoma Workup:** If chest CT reveals a thymic mass, do you recommend early surgical referral regardless of antibody status, or are there specific features that would prompt"

If symptoms are mild, do you ever defer immunosuppressive therapy initially, or do you favor early initiation to prevent progression? 2. **Monitoring for Respiratory Involvement:** Although the patient currently denies dyspnea, are there specific bedside assessments or thresholds (e.g., single breath count, negative inspiratory force) you recommend for monitoring, especially given the presence of bulbar symptoms? At what point would you consider inpatient monitoring? 3. **Role of IVIG/Plasmapheresis:** If the patient\u2019s symptoms were to acutely worsen (e"

For respiratory monitoring, regularly assess single breath count (<20), forced vital capacity (<15\u201320 mL/kg), and negative inspiratory force (<-20 cm H2O); inpatient monitoring is warranted if these thresholds are approached or if there is any evidence of rapid progression or aspiration risk. 3.
