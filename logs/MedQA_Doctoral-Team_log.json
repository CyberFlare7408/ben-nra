There is no history of preceding infection, which makes post-infectious causes less likely. 2. **Distribution of Weakness:** The involvement of ocular, bulbar, and proximal limb muscles, with sparing of respiratory muscles so far, is typical for generalized MG. There are no sensory findings or muscle atrophy. 3. **Differential Diagnosis:** - **Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS):** Less likely given the absence of autonomic symptoms, areflexia, or improvement with activity. - **Botulism:** Unlikely without"

Are there specific thresholds for FVC or NIF that would prompt admission in your practice? 2. **Autoimmune Workup:** Would you recommend screening for other autoimmune conditions (e.g., thyroid function, ANA) at this stage, given the association of MG with other autoimmune diseases, or would you reserve this for later if clinical suspicion arises? 3. **Steroid Initiation:** If the patient responds well to pyridostigmine but remains symptomatic, at what point would you consider initiating corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive therapy? Do you have a preferred protocol for steroid initiation in newly diagnosed generalized MG?"

This is common in athletes after repetitive stress or twisting. - **Medial meniscus injury:** The mechanism (twisting) raises suspicion, but the absence of locking, catching, or significant swelling makes this less likely, though not impossible."

The absence of external rotation is somewhat atypical, as femoral neck fractures often present with external rotation, but internal rotation can occur depending on the fracture pattern and muscle spasm."

There are no overlying skin changes or signs of infection. This makes reactive lymphadenopathy or infectious causes less likely. 2. **Absence of Systemic Symptoms:** The lack of B symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss) makes aggressive lymphoma less likely, though indolent lymphoma or other malignancies cannot be ruled out. 3. **Benign vs Malignant:** While benign tumors (e.g., fibroma, neurofibroma, or deep-seated epidermoid cyst)"

The absence of trauma, preeclampsia symptoms, or known placenta previa further supports this. To refine our diagnosis and guide management, I have a few follow-up questions and considerations: 1. **Onset and Character of Pain:** - The patient describes severe, persistent abdominal pain rather than intermittent pain associated with contractions. This is more characteristic of abruption than labor or uterine rupture, though the latter remains a concern given her surgical history. 2. **Uterine Tone and Fundal Height:** - On examination, is the uterus tender, rigid, or \u201cwoody\u201d on palpation? - Is there any increase in fundal height suggestive of concealed bleeding? 3. **Maternal"

To summarize, we have a patient with a one-month history of progressive abdominal distension, early satiety, and exertional dyspnea, but no pain, GI or urinary changes, peripheral edema, jaundice, constitutional symptoms, or prior history of cardiac, hepatic, or renal disease. There is no history of malignancy or family history of serious illness. **My initial thoughts and questions:** 1. **Ascites seems likely** given the abdominal distension and early satiety, especially in the absence of weight gain (suggesting fluid rather than fat or mass). The lack of peripheral edema and no cardiac/renal history makes cardiac or nephrotic causes less likely, but not impossible. 2. **Shortness of breath** could be due to increased intra-abdominal pressure from ascites, or possibly a pleural effusion. 3. **No pain, jaundice, or constitutional symptoms** makes acute liver failure, peritonitis, or"

If the ultrasound shows complex ascites or masses, would you proceed directly to CT for further characterization? 2. **Paracentesis**: In addition to cell count, albumin, cytology, and cultures (including AFB and ADA if indicated), would you routinely send for triglycerides (to rule out chylous ascites) or amylase (to assess for pancreatic etiology), or reserve these for specific clinical suspicion? 3. **Gynecologic Evaluation**: Given the patient\u2019s gender (assuming female) and the concern for ovarian malignancy, would you recommend concurrent pelvic examination and transvaginal ultrasound"

Would you recommend calculating SAAG in all cases, or only if the etiology remains unclear after initial studies? - For cytology, do you find that sending a larger volume (e.g., >50 mL) improves diagnostic yield for malignancy? 2. **Malignancy Workup**: - If imaging or cytology is suggestive of"
