I agree that the clinical picture is highly suggestive of myasthenia gravis, particularly with the classic features of fluctuating, fatigable weakness, ocular involvement, and mild bulbar symptoms without sensory or autonomic findings. A few points to clarify and discuss further: 1. **Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS):** While less likely, I want to confirm that LEMS is lower on our differential given the absence of autonomic symptoms, lack of proximal leg weakness predominance, and no improvement with exertion (as seen in LEMS). The patient\u2019s symptoms worsen with activity and heat, which is more typical of MG. Do you agree that LEMS is unlikely, or would you recommend any specific testing to rule it out? 2. **Other Differential Diagnoses:** - **Mitochondrial myopathies** and **congenital myasthenic syndromes** seem less likely given"

Proceed with the outlined MG workup, and let me know if any atypical features develop."

I agree that the clinical presentation and history are most consistent with myasthenia gravis, and that LEMS, mitochondrial myopathies, and congenital myasthenic syndromes are unlikely given the current findings. A few points to further refine our approach: 1. **Ocular vs. Generalized MG:** Given the patient\u2019s prominent ocular symptoms (diplopia, ptosis) and mild bulbar involvement, but no limb or respiratory muscle weakness at rest, do you think this is more likely to be ocular MG with early mild generalization, or should we anticipate progression to generalized MG? Would you recommend early initiation of immunosuppressive therapy, or start with symptomatic management (e.g., pyridostigmine) and monitor for progression? 2. **Thymoma Screening:** Would you recommend a CT or MRI of the chest at this stage, even if the antibody panel is pending, or"

I recommend starting symptomatic therapy with pyridostigmine initially, reserving immunosuppressive therapy for those with inadequate response or progression. Chest CT (preferred over MRI) for thymoma screening should be performed at diagnosis, regardless of antibody status, as thymoma can occur even in seronegative cases."

A few points for further discussion and clarification: 1. **Monitoring for Progression:** - Are there specific clinical signs or symptoms you recommend prioritizing during follow-up to detect early respiratory or more significant bulbar involvement? - Would you suggest routine spirometry (e.g., FVC, NIF) at baseline and during follow-up, even in the absence of overt respiratory symptoms? 2. **Initiation and Titration of Pyridostigmine:** - Do you have a preferred starting dose and titration schedule for pyridostigmine in this context? - Are there particular side effects or contraindications I should be especially vigilant for in this patient population? 3. **Role of Steroids/Immunosuppressants:** - If the patient demonstrates early"

If AChR and MuSK antibodies are negative but clinical/electrophysiological evidence supports MG, I recommend LRP4 antibody testing if available, though management is still based on clinical diagnosis. Seronegative MG generally responds similarly to standard therapies, though MuSK-positive cases may require more aggressive immunosuppression. If electrophysiological studies are equivocal, consider repeating them or using alternative sites/muscles; single-fiber EMG is most sensitive. For thymic masses, refer to thoracic surgery for evaluation and multidisciplinary discussion, as resection is indicated for thymoma regardless of MG antibody status."
