I have a few follow-up questions and thoughts to further refine our approach: 1. **Seronegative MG and MuSK Antibodies:** If acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies are negative, would you recommend testing for muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) antibodies, given the occasional bulbar involvement? Are there any clinical features that would make you suspect MuSK-positive MG in this patient? 2. **Electrodiagnostic Testing:** Would you prioritize single-fiber EMG over repetitive nerve stimulation if initial tests are inconclusive, especially given the subtle bulbar symptoms? 3. **Thymoma Screening:** For chest imaging, do you prefer CT or MRI for thymoma screening in this context? Would you recommend this for all new MG diagnoses, even if the patient is relatively young and"

Yes, if AChR antibodies are negative, MuSK antibody testing is indicated, especially with bulbar symptoms; MuSK-MG often presents with prominent bulbar and facial weakness, sometimes with neck or respiratory involvement, but less ocular-only disease. 2. If repetitive nerve stimulation is inconclusive, single-fiber EMG is more sensitive and should be prioritized, particularly for subtle or predominantly ocular/bulbar cases. 3. Chest CT is preferred for thymoma screening due to better sensitivity for small lesions; I recommend imaging for all new MG diagnoses regardless of age, as thymoma can occur in younger patients."

Would this distinction influence your initial treatment approach (e.g., starting with pyridostigmine alone vs. early immunosuppression)? 2. **Role of Other Autoimmune Screening:** Would you recommend routine screening for other autoimmune conditions (e.g., thyroid function, ANA) at this stage, even in the absence of symptoms or family history, given the association with MG? 3. **Monitoring for Respiratory Involvement:**"

The presence of bulbar symptoms, even if mild and fatigable, suggests early generalized MG rather than purely ocular MG, which would influence me to monitor closely for further generalization and consider early immunosuppression if symptoms progress or are functionally limiting. 2. Yes, I recommend routine screening for thyroid dysfunction and ANA, as MG is associated with other autoimmune diseases even in asymptomatic patients. 3. For respiratory monitoring, regular assessment of vital capacity and negative inspiratory force is important, especially if symptoms worsen or new bulbar/respiratory complaints arise."

A few additional points for your input: 1. **Frequency and Follow-up:** - How soon after initiating pyridostigmine would you recommend reassessing the patient, both clinically and with objective measures (e.g., bedside forced vital capacity, quantitative MG scores)? - Would you recommend a specific frequency for follow-up visits in the first few months, given the risk of early generalization? 2. **Steroid-Sparing Agents:** - If immunosuppression becomes necessary, do you have a preferred steroid-sparing agent (e.g., azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil) in this clinical scenario, or do you typically start with corticosteroids alone and add a steroid-sparing agent later? 3."
