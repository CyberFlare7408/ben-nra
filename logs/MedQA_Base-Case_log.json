The absence of sensory symptoms and the improvement with rest further support this. **Differential diagnoses I am considering:** 1. **Myasthenia gravis** (most"

Next steps should include bedside tests (ice pack test, edrophonium if available), acetylcholine receptor and MuSK antibody testing, and chest imaging to assess for thymoma. EMG with repetitive nerve stimulation or single-fiber EMG can further confirm the diagnosis."

I agree that the clinical picture is highly suggestive of myasthenia gravis, particularly with the prominent ocular and mild bulbar involvement, and the absence of sensory or systemic symptoms. A few points to clarify and discuss further: 1. **Onset and Progression:** - The patient reports about a month of symptoms, with no acute or rapidly progressive deterioration. Would you consider this a typical subacute presentation for MG, or should we be more concerned about a possible myasthenic crisis or impending respiratory involvement, even in the absence of current breathing difficulties? 2. **Seronegative MG:** - If acetylcholine receptor and MuSK antibodies are negative, would you recommend further antibody testing (e.g., LRP4) or proceed primarily with electrophysiological studies? 3. **Differential Diagnosis:** - Are there any features here that would prompt you to consider alternative diagnoses, such as Lambert-Eaton myasthen"

If AChR and MuSK antibodies are negative, I recommend both LRP4 antibody testing and electrophysiological studies, as seronegative MG is possible. 3. The absence of autonomic symptoms, proximal leg > arm weakness, and areflexia makes Lambert-Eaton less likely, but if weakness becomes more proximal/leg-predominant or reflexes decrease, reconsider this and screen for malignancy."

I agree that ongoing monitoring for respiratory and bulbar function is crucial, even in the absence of current symptoms, given the risk of insidious progression to myasthenic crisis. A few additional points and questions for further clarification: 1. **Ocular vs. Generalized MG:** - Given the patient\u2019s prominent ocular symptoms (diplopia, ptosis) and mild bulbar involvement, but no limb weakness at rest, would you classify this as ocular MG with early generalization, or as generalized MG with predominantly ocular/bulbar features? - Does this distinction influence your initial treatment approach (e.g., symptomatic therapy alone vs. early immunosuppression)? 2. **Role of Thymoma Screening:** - Would you recommend chest imaging (CT or MRI) at this stage for all patients, even in the absence of systemic symptoms, or only if antibody testing is positive? 3. **Initiation of Therapy:**"

The presence of bulbar symptoms (even if mild) alongside ocular findings suggests early generalized MG rather than purely ocular MG, which does influence management\u2014early immunosuppression is generally favored over symptomatic therapy alone in generalized cases. 2. I recommend chest imaging (CT preferred) for all newly diagnosed MG patients regardless of antibody status, as thymoma can occur even in seronegative cases. 3. For therapy initiation, start with pyridostigmine for symptomatic relief and consider early corticosteroids or steroid-sparing immunosuppressants given the generalized features."

I agree that the presence of bulbar symptoms, even if mild and only apparent with fatigue, tips the balance toward early generalized MG and warrants a more proactive approach. A few follow-up points for your input: 1. **Monitoring and Escalation:** - Given the current absence of respiratory involvement, would you recommend routine bedside spirometry (e.g., FVC, NIF) at each visit, or only if new symptoms arise? - Are there specific thresholds (e.g., FVC <20 mL/kg) at which you would recommend hospital admission or more intensive monitoring, even in a patient who is otherwise stable? 2. **Steroid Initiation:** - In your experience, do you prefer starting with low-dose corticosteroids and titrating up to minimize the risk of transient worsening, or do you initiate at a moderate dose given the early generalized features? - Would you consider inpatient initiation of steroids in this patient, or"
