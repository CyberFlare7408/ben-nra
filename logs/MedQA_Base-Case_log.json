Would you consider this early generalized MG, and does this influence your initial treatment approach (e.g., starting with pyridostigmine alone vs. adding immunosuppression early)? 2. **Antibody Testing**: If acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies are negative, would you recommend proceeding directly to MuSK and LRP4 antibody testing, or would you prioritize electrophysiological studies first? 3. **Thymoma Screening**: Given the absence of systemic symptoms and the patient\u2019s age (not"

If AChR antibodies are negative, I recommend sending MuSK and LRP4 antibodies in parallel with electrophysiological studies, as both can aid diagnosis. 3. Thymoma screening (chest CT or MRI) is indicated in all MG patients regardless of age or symptom severity, as thymoma can be present even without systemic symptoms."

I have a few follow-up questions and points for further discussion: 1. **Monitoring for Myasthenic Crisis:** Given the patient\u2019s mild bulbar symptoms (occasional slurred speech when fatigued), would you recommend any specific monitoring or precautions to detect early signs of respiratory compromise or impending myasthenic crisis, especially as we initiate pyridostigmine? Would you suggest baseline pulmonary function testing (e.g., FVC, NIF) even in the absence of overt respiratory symptoms? 2. **Role of Steroids and Immunosuppressants:** If the patient\u2019s symptoms progress or do not respond adequately to pyridostigmine, do you have a preferred initial immunosuppressive agent (e.g., prednisone vs. steroid-sparing agents), and do you have a threshold for when to introduce these? Are there any factors in this patient\u2019s presentation that would make you consider earlier initiation of immunosuppression? 3"

Yes, I recommend baseline pulmonary function testing (FVC, NIF) even without overt respiratory symptoms, and close monitoring for signs of crisis (e.g., worsening bulbar symptoms, dyspnea, weak cough). 2. If pyridostigmine is insufficient, I typically start prednisone as the initial immunosuppressant, adding a steroid-sparing agent if long-term therapy is needed or if there are contraindications; I consider immunosuppression if symptoms are disabling, progressive, or involve bulbar/respiratory muscles. 3. In this patient, mild bulbar involvement alone does not mandate early immunosuppression, but rapid progression or poor response to pyridostigmine would lower my threshold."

I agree with your approach and will proceed with baseline pulmonary function testing and close monitoring for any signs of respiratory compromise. A few additional points for discussion: 1. **Electrophysiological Testing:** Would you recommend prioritizing single-fiber EMG over repetitive nerve stimulation in this case, given the subtlety of bulbar involvement and the possibility of early generalized MG? Are there particular muscle groups you prefer to test in patients with predominantly ocular and mild limb symptoms? 2. **Antibody-Negative MG:** If both AChR and MuSK antibodies return negative, but clinical and electrophysiological findings remain strongly suggestive of MG, would you recommend empiric treatment and continued follow-up, or would you consider alternative diagnoses at that point? Are there specific features that would prompt you to revisit the differential (e.g., congenital myasthenic syndromes, Lambert-Eaton, mitochondrial myopathies)? 3. **Patient Education and Safety:**"

Single-fiber EMG is more sensitive than repetitive nerve stimulation, especially in mild or predominantly ocular MG, so I would prioritize it; I typically test the orbicularis oculi or frontalis for ocular symptoms, and deltoid or extensor digitorum for limb involvement. 2. If both AChR and MuSK antibodies are negative but clinical/electrophysiological evidence supports MG, empiric treatment and close follow-up are appropriate; I would reconsider the differential if there is poor response to therapy, atypical features (e.g., early onset, family history, autonomic symptoms, or prominent atrophy), or if electrophysiology is non-diagnostic. 3. For patient education, I emphasize medication adherence, recognizing signs of crisis, avoiding exacerbating drugs, and when to seek urgent care; written instructions and emergency contact information are helpful."

I have a few additional questions and points for clarification as we proceed: 1. **Duration and Prognosis:** Given that the patient\u2019s symptoms have been present for about a month and are gradually worsening, do you find this time course typical for early generalized MG, or does the relatively rapid progression raise any concern for alternative or overlapping diagnoses (e.g., paraneoplastic syndromes, acute inflammatory neuropathies)? Would you recommend any additional screening for malignancy beyond thymoma at this stage? 2. **Overlap Syndromes:** In your experience, are there particular clinical or laboratory features that would prompt you to consider overlap with other neuromuscular junction disorders, such as Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), especially in the absence of autonomic symptoms? Would you recommend routine voltage-gated calcium channel antibody testing in seronegative cases? 3. **Steroid Initiation:** When starting prednisone, do you routinely hospitalize patients for monitoring,"

The subacute, gradually worsening course is typical for early generalized MG, but if there are atypical features (rapid progression, prominent systemic symptoms, or poor response to initial therapy), consider broader malignancy screening (e.g., CT chest/abdomen/pelvis) and paraneoplastic panels. 2. LEMS is suggested by proximal leg > arm weakness, autonomic symptoms, and reduced/absent reflexes; in seronegative MG with atypical features, I recommend voltage-gated calcium channel antibody testing. 3. I do not routinely hospitalize for steroid initiation unless there is significant bulbar/respiratory involvement or rapid progression, but close outpatient monitoring is essential."
