I agree that the clinical picture is most consistent with myasthenia gravis, particularly given the classic fatigability, ocular involvement, and absence of sensory or systemic features. A few points to clarify and discuss further: 1. **Seronegative Myasthenia**: If acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies are negative, would you recommend testing for MuSK (muscle-specific kinase) antibodies, especially if the clinical suspicion remains high? 2. **Electrophysiological Testing**: In your experience, is single-fiber EMG more sensitive than repetitive nerve stimulation in cases with predominantly ocular or mild generalized symptoms? Would you prioritize one over the other in this scenario? 3. **Thymoma Screening**: Given the absence of systemic symptoms or palpable masses, do you recommend a CT scan of the chest for all new myasthenia gravis diagnoses, or only if there are additional risk factors or findings? 4. **Differ"

Yes, if AChR antibodies are negative and suspicion remains high, MuSK antibody testing is indicated, as MuSK-positive MG can present similarly but may require different management. 2. Single-fiber EMG is more sensitive than repetitive nerve stimulation, especially in mild or purely ocular cases, so I would prioritize single-fiber EMG if available. 3. Chest CT is recommended for all new MG diagnoses to screen for thymoma, regardless of symptoms, as thymomas can be asymptomatic. 4.

To further refine our diagnostic approach and ensure we are not missing alternative or coexisting conditions, I\u2019d like to discuss the following: 4. **Differential Diagnosis**: While the presentation is classic for myasthenia gravis, are there any features in this case that would prompt you to consider alternative diagnoses, such as Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), mitochondrial myopathies, or other neuromuscular junction disorders? For example, the absence of autonomic symptoms and the clear fatigability seem less consistent with LEMS, but I\u2019d appreciate your thoughts on distinguishing features you look for clinically. 5. **Ocular Myasthenia vs. Generalized Myasthenia**: Given the patient\u2019s symptoms are predominantly ocular and mild bulbar/facial, but with some proximal limb involvement, would you classify this as early generalized MG? Does this influence your initial treatment approach (e.g., starting with pyridostig"

The absence of autonomic symptoms, presence of clear fatigability, and lack of improvement with exercise make LEMS unlikely; mitochondrial myopathies typically present with fixed weakness and often have multisystem involvement. 5. Given the proximal limb involvement, I would classify this as early generalized MG, which supports starting pyridostigmine and considering early immunosuppression rather than limiting treatment to symptomatic ocular therapy."

A few additional points and questions to further refine our approach: **1. Monitoring for Respiratory Involvement:** Although the patient currently denies dyspnea or swallowing difficulties, are there specific bedside assessments or monitoring protocols you recommend to detect early respiratory or bulbar compromise, especially as we initiate treatment? **2. Initiation of Immunosuppression:** Given the mild but generalized symptoms, would you recommend starting corticosteroids immediately alongside pyridostigmine, or do you prefer a trial of symptomatic therapy first? If starting steroids, do you have a preferred dosing regimen or tapering strategy to minimize the risk of steroid-induced worsening? **3. Thymectomy Considerations:** If chest imaging reveals thymic hyperplasia but not a discrete thymoma, would you recommend thymectomy in this patient, given their age and early generalized symptoms"

For early detection of respiratory or bulbar compromise, I recommend regular bedside monitoring of forced vital capacity (FVC), negative inspiratory force (NIF), and simple swallowing assessments (e.g., counting aloud, single breath count, and monitoring for dysarthria or cough after swallowing). 2. For mild generalized MG, I typically start pyridostigmine and closely monitor; if symptoms persist or worsen, I add corticosteroids, starting low (e.g., prednisone 10\u201320 mg daily) and titrating up to minimize risk of transient worsening, then taper slowly as symptoms improve. 3. Thymectomy is generally recommended for patients under 60 with generalized MG and thymic hyperplasia, as it can improve long-term outcomes even without a discrete thymoma."

Would you advise more frequent assessments in the first few weeks, or only if symptoms change? - Are there specific thresholds (e.g., FVC <20 mL/kg) that would prompt you to consider hospital admission or more intensive monitoring, even in the absence of overt respiratory distress? **2. Steroid Initiation:** - In your experience, how often do you observe steroid-induced worsening in mild generalized MG, and are there particular risk factors that would make you more cautious about starting corticosteroids? - Do you routinely use steroid-sparing immunosuppressants (e.g., azathioprine, mycophenolate) early in the disease course, or reserve"
