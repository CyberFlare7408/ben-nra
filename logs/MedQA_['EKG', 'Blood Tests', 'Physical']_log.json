Most ocular MG cases that generalize do so within the first 2\u20133 years, with early limb or bulbar involvement being a predictor. 2. For steroids, I start with a low dose (e.g., prednisone 10\u201320 mg daily), increasing gradually every 1\u20132 weeks to minimize risk of transient worsening, and consider adding a steroid-sparing agent early if moderate/severe disease or anticipated prolonged therapy."

A few follow-up points and questions to further clarify our approach: 1. **Spinal Involvement:** - The patient has not reported any back pain, lower limb weakness, numbness, or bowel/bladder dysfunction. On exam, there is no spinal tenderness or neurologic deficit. Would you still recommend spinal imaging at this stage, or would you reserve it for the development of new symptoms? 2. **Blood Cultures and Microbiology:** - Given the prior antibiotic exposure, do you have recommendations for the number and timing of blood cultures? - Would you empirically cover for MRSA and Gram-negatives, or do you suggest tailoring initial therapy based on local resistance patterns and the patient\u2019s"

Given the patient\u2019s stable renal function and the need to evaluate for deep-seated abscess, I am leaning toward CT for better sensitivity and anatomical detail, but would appreciate your input. 2. **Atypical or Resistant Organisms:** - Given the prior antibiotic exposure and subacute course, are there specific atypical organisms (e.g., fungal, mycobacterial, or resistant Gram-negatives) you would want to consider or test for at this stage? - Would you recommend any additional serologic or microbiologic"

Lack of swelling, redness, or warmth makes infection less likely. 2. **Medial Collateral Ligament (MCL)"

If pain persists beyond 2 weeks or worsens, consider imaging (MRI) to rule out meniscal or ligamentous injury."

I agree that pes anserine bursitis is the leading diagnosis, given the focal tenderness just below the medial knee, the absence of joint effusion, and the activity history. I also concur that an MCL strain is possible, though the lack of instability or significant trauma makes this less likely. A few points to clarify and discuss further: 1. **On Examination:** - The patient reports tenderness specifically over the medial aspect just below the joint line, but not directly over the MCL itself. There is no joint line tenderness or pain with valgus stress, which would further support pes anserine bursitis over MCL injury. - There is no effusion, and the range of motion is preserved, albeit painful at extremes of flexion. 2. **Meniscal Injury:** - Given the absence of locking, catching, or joint line tenderness, and the acute onset after activity rather than a specific twisting injury, meniscal tear seems"

There is no tenderness over the patellar tendon or tibial tuberosity. - Would you recommend any additional maneuvers or specific examination techniques to further distinguish pes anserine bursitis from early medial compartment pathology or other soft tissue injuries? 2. **Consideration of Early Stress Injury:** - Given the patient\u2019s recent increase in activity and weight loss efforts, is there any concern for a stress reaction or early stress fracture of the proximal tibia, even in the absence of swelling"

Infants with CRS-related PDA can develop pulmonary hypertension over time, so serial assessment is important even if initial studies are normal. The absence of growth restriction, hepatosplenomegaly, or thrombocytopenia is slightly atypical for CRS, so a broad metabolic/genetic workup (including lysosomal storage disorders and peroxisomal disorders) remains warranted if initial infectious studies are negative."

A few points and questions to further refine our assessment: 1. **Shortness of Breath**: The patient reports some mild difficulty breathing. While she denies chest pain and has no leg swelling or redness, should we consider a low threshold for evaluating for pulmonary embolism (PE), given the postpartum state and new-onset dyspnea? Would you recommend any initial workup (e.g., pulse oximetry, D-dimer, or imaging) at this stage, or should we monitor for progression of symptoms? 2. **Imaging**: If the patient does not improve within 48\u201372 hours of antibiotics, would you recommend a pelvic ultrasound to assess for retained products of conception or abscess formation"

Would you suggest any additional baseline labs beyond blood cultures and urinalysis? 2. **Antibiotic Coverage:** If the patient has a penicillin allergy (not currently reported, but for future reference), what would be your preferred alternative antibiotic regimen for postpartum endometritis? 3. **Shortness of Breath:** If the patient\u2019s pulse oximetry is normal and her dyspnea remains mild and stable, would you recommend observation, or should we proceed with D-dimer or imaging regardless, given"
