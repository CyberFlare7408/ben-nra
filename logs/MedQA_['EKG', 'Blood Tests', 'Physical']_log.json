Would you recommend starting with a lower dose of pyridostigmine, or should we anticipate the need for immunosuppressive therapy early on? 2. **Antibody Testing:** In your experience, if both acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and MuSK antibodies are negative, would you recommend testing for LRP4 antibodies, or would you proceed based on clinical and electrophysiological findings? 3. **Thymoma Screening:** For chest imaging, do"

The presence of bulbar and proximal limb weakness alongside ocular symptoms is consistent with generalized MG, so I would start pyridostigmine at a standard dose and monitor closely, anticipating the need for immunosuppressive therapy if symptoms are not controlled. 2. If both AChR and MuSK antibodies are negative, LRP4 antibody testing can be considered, but clinical and electrophysiological findings remain central to diagnosis. 3. For thymoma screening, I recommend a contrast-enhanced chest CT as the initial imaging modality."

Are there particular muscle groups you recommend targeting during these studies to maximize diagnostic yield? 2. **Early Immunosuppression:** If the patient demonstrates rapid progression or significant bulbar symptoms (e.g., worsening dysphagia or dysarthria), would you consider initiating corticosteroids or another immunosuppressive agent early, even before antibody results return? Do you have a preferred initial immunosuppressive regimen in such cases? 3. **Monitoring for Myasthenic Crisis:** Given the presence of bulbar symptoms, what specific signs or thresholds would prompt you to consider inpatient monitoring or early intervention to prevent myasthenic crisis?

Single-fiber EMG is more sensitive than repetitive nerve stimulation, especially in mild or predominantly ocular/bulbar cases; I recommend targeting facial (orbicularis oculi/oris) and proximal limb muscles. 2. For rapidly progressive or severe bulbar symptoms, I would initiate corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone) early, often with a steroid-sparing agent (such as azathioprine or mycophenolate), even before antibody results. 3. Red flags for myasthenic crisis include rapidly worsening dysphagia (risk of aspiration), inability to handle secretions, significant dysarthria, or any signs of respiratory compromise (e.g., declining vital capacity, weak cough); these warrant inpatient monitoring and possible ICU admission."

Are there particular scenarios where you find the Tensilon test especially helpful or, conversely, unnecessary? 2. **Management of Ocular Symptoms:** If the patient\u2019s diplopia and ptosis remain prominent despite initial pyridostigmine therapy, do you have recommendations for symptomatic management (e.g., eye patching, prism lenses), or would you escalate immunosuppression at that stage? 3. **Steroid Initiation and Worsening:** When starting corticosteroids, do you routinely hospitalize patients for monitoring, given the risk of transient worsening?

The edrophonium (Tensilon) test is rarely needed if serologic and electrophysiological studies are available and supportive; I reserve it for atypical cases or when rapid bedside confirmation is needed. 2. For persistent ocular symptoms, temporary measures like eye patching or prism lenses can help, but if symptoms are functionally limiting, escalation of immunosuppression should be considered. 3. I recommend hospital monitoring when starting steroids in patients with significant bulbar or respiratory involvement, poor baseline function, or rapid progression, as these groups are at higher risk for steroid-induced worsening."

However, are there any specific features or red flags you look for that would prompt you to reconsider alternative diagnoses such as Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) or a mitochondrial myopathy, especially in the early stages? Would you recommend any additional screening (e.g., voltage-gated calcium channel antibody testing, CK levels, or lactate) in this case? 2. **Long-term Management and Prognosis:** Assuming the diagnosis of generalized MG is confirmed, do you have a preferred approach for long-term immunosuppression (e.g., azathioprine vs. mycophenolate mofetil), and how do you typically monitor for treatment response and"
