Do you have a preferred initial immunosuppressive regimen in such cases? 3. **Monitoring for Myasthenic Crisis:** Given the presence of bulbar symptoms, what specific signs or thresholds would prompt you to consider inpatient monitoring or early intervention to prevent myasthenic crisis?

Red flags for myasthenic crisis include rapidly worsening dysphagia (risk of aspiration), inability to handle secretions, significant dysarthria, or any signs of respiratory compromise (e.g., declining vital capacity, weak cough); these warrant inpatient monitoring and possible ICU admission."

However, are there any specific features or red flags you look for that would prompt you to reconsider alternative diagnoses such as Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) or a mitochondrial myopathy, especially in the early stages? Would you recommend any additional screening (e.g., voltage-gated calcium channel antibody testing, CK levels, or lactate) in this case? 2. **Long-term Management and Prognosis:** Assuming the diagnosis of generalized MG is confirmed, do you have a preferred approach for long-term immunosuppression (e.g., azathioprine vs. mycophenolate mofetil), and how do you typically monitor for treatment response and"

Is there any role for ultrasound-guided core biopsy if excisional biopsy is not feasible? 2. **Laboratory Workup:** In addition to LDH and uric acid, would you suggest baseline liver and renal function tests, HIV serology, and hepatitis B/C screening prior to biopsy and potential therapy initiation? Should we also check for baseline thyroid function, given the neck involvement? 3. **Peripheral Smear and Infectious Workup:** Given the mild anemia and leukocytosis, would you prioritize a peripheral blood smear now, or wait for imaging/biopsy results?

CRS-associated PDAs are not structurally different, but may be larger and less responsive to medical closure, so early surgical consultation is prudent. In addition to CRS, consider CMV and other TORCH infections; a full infectious workup and metabolic panel are warranted, and a detailed echocardiogram to assess for additional defects (e.g., pulmonary artery stenosis) is advised."

While this could be due to postpartum diuresis or irritation, do you think we should also obtain a urinalysis and urine culture to definitively rule out a concurrent urinary tract infection, especially since postpartum women are at increased risk? 2. **Shortness of Breath:** She mentions minor shortness of breath but no tachycardia, dizziness, or leg swelling. Would you recommend any additional workup (e.g., chest imaging, D-dimer) to rule out early pulmonary embolism, or do you feel this is likely related to her infection and postpartum state? 3. **Antibiotic Coverage:** Would you"

Are there particular organisms (e.g., MRSA, ESBL-producing gram-negatives) you are seeing more frequently in postpartum endometritis in our area? 2. **Role of Anaerobic Coverage:** Clindamycin provides good anaerobic coverage, but in cases where clindamycin is contraindicated (e.g., allergy), what is your preferred alternative for anaerobic coverage in postpartum endometritis? Would you consider metronidazole plus a broad-spectrum beta-lactam? 3. **Follow-up and Discharge Planning"

If clindamycin is contraindicated, metronidazole plus a broad-spectrum beta-lactam (e.g., ceftriaxone or piperacillin-tazobactam) is an effective alternative for anaerobic coverage. 3. For follow-up/discharge, ensure clinical stability (afebrile \u226524 hours, improving symptoms), ability to tolerate oral antibiotics, and arrange close outpatient follow-up within 1 week to monitor for relapse or complications."
