For thymoma screening, a contrast-enhanced chest CT is typically first-line due to its sensitivity and accessibility; MRI is reserved for equivocal cases or if CT is contraindicated. If a thymoma is found, referral to a thoracic surgeon with experience in thymic tumors and a multidisciplinary tumor board is recommended. 2. Outpatient management is reasonable if FVC and NIF are normal and there are no signs of impending crisis, but close monitoring and clear return precautions are essential given bulbar symptoms. 3. I usually start with corticosteroids, but in younger patients or those at higher risk for steroid side effects, early introduction of a steroid-sparing agent (e.g., azathioprine or mycophenolate) can be considered."

Preoperatively, optimize MG control (pyridostigmine, steroids if needed), minimize anticholinesterase dose on the day of surgery, and coordinate with anesthesia for non-depolarizing agents and perioperative respiratory monitoring. 2. Steroid response may take weeks (often 2\u20134 weeks for initial improvement, up to several months for maximal effect); I start low and taper slowly to minimize risk of exacerbation (e.g., increase by 5 mg every 1\u20132 weeks). Azathioprine and mycophenolate are both effective; azathioprine has more data but slower onset and requires TPMT testing, while mycophenolate is generally better tolerated but also slow to act. IVIG or plasma exchange is reserved for severe, rapidly progressive, or refractory"

Are there particular warning signs you advise patients to watch for at home? 2. **Steroid Initiation and Risk of Exacerbation:** You mentioned starting corticosteroids at a low dose and titrating slowly to avoid exacerbation. In your practice, do you routinely hospitalize patients for steroid initiation if they have bulbar symptoms, or is close outpatient follow-up sufficient? Would you consider bridging with IVIG or plasma exchange during steroid initiation in this context? 3. **Choice of Steroid-Sparing Agent:** If the patient is a young woman of childbearing age, do you have"
