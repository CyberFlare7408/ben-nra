Outpatient management is reasonable if FVC and NIF are normal and there are no signs of impending crisis, but close monitoring and clear return precautions are essential given bulbar symptoms. 3. I usually start with corticosteroids, but in younger patients or those at higher risk for steroid side effects, early introduction of a steroid-sparing agent (e.g., azathioprine or mycophenolate) can be considered."

Preoperatively, optimize MG control (pyridostigmine, steroids if needed), minimize anticholinesterase dose on the day of surgery, and coordinate with anesthesia for non-depolarizing agents and perioperative respiratory monitoring. 2. Steroid response may take weeks (often 2\u20134 weeks for initial improvement, up to several months for maximal effect); I start low and taper slowly to minimize risk of exacerbation (e.g., increase by 5 mg every 1\u20132 weeks). Azathioprine and mycophenolate are both effective; azathioprine has more data but slower onset and requires TPMT testing, while mycophenolate is generally better tolerated but also slow to act.

In your practice, do you routinely hospitalize patients for steroid initiation if they have bulbar symptoms, or is close outpatient follow-up sufficient?
